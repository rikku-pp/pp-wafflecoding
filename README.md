[Introduction Slides from the workshop](https://cdn.glitch.com/990280b7-f679-42a2-8ecf-561616765eac%2FV%C3%A5ffelkodning%20rev2.pdf?1521985253945)

The hand-on part has rather free form. 

1. Start by remixing this project
2. Choose one or several methods of styling
  - in `index.html`
  - in `public/css/wafflecoding.css`, or
  - temporarily in your browser's Developer Tools. See [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/css/), [Safari DevTools](https://developer.apple.com/safari/tools/) or [Firefox Style Editor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Style_Editor)
3. Try different tasks. Starting with:
  - Restyle the existing site
  - Reuse some style
  - Make some additional styles

A few suggestions for (3) above:
- change font and header styles
- add a new `<section>`
- replace the color theme (maybe with [this scheme](https://coolors.co/db812e-662d19-f2ee8c-d85b08-dd3e08))

There are lots of CSS rules, which are very hard to master and the less learn by heart. There are some useful guides listed in `CSS-HANDBOOKS.md`, as well as plenty of searchable CSS-faqs on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)

HAPPY CODING!
